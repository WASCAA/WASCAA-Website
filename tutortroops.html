My previous work within teaching includes being an instructor for computer science based summer camps and elementary after-school classes, and my favorite part of these experiences is whenever I am able to help a student understand a new concept â€” it's always a joy to see a student smile after accomplishing a difficult task.

I love to teach others and I have experience in multiple subjects, but I am best at biology and history. I love to work with kids of all ages and I am easily flexible. I have experience as a tutor with the KCLS and I hope to use that experience and bring it over here. Teaching has always been an interest of mine, and being able to help someone understand a difficult subject or even a difficult problem is what motivates me. Most importantly, for me seeing a student not only understand what they are learning but also seeing that they are now more confident in a certain subject, makes the tutoring experience all the more enjoyable.
