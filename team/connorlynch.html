						<h3>Personal Biography</h3>
						<p>Connor Lynch is a current senior at Inglemoor High School. He is heavily involved in his school’s clubs and activities, primarily focusing his attention towards Model United Nations (MUN) and Orienteering. From MUN specifically, Connor has developed the skills of cooperation, teamwork, and writing, which he believes can be utilized to help WASCAA best reach its goals. On top of this, he is a devoted member of his school’s cross country and track and field teams. Besides spending time with his friends, his favorite pastimes are running and exercising. Connor aspires to be an engineer sometime in the future, and thus immerses himself into courses like Design and Technology that focus on formulating, modeling, and creating new projects and ideas.

<br /><br />In the last couple years, Connor has had many family members and family friends diagnosed with cancer. His grandfather died of prostate cancer in 2016, and has since had multiple close friends and family who have been negatively impacted by the disease. Because of these events, Connor has become motivated to make a difference in any way he can. Through WASCAA, he hopes to be able to help foster his community and to minimize the amount of people that have to experience the pain of loss to cancer.
