						<h3>Personal Biography</h3>
						<p>First and foremost, thank you for taking a look at our website. If you notice anything that you believe should be changed, please send us an email whenever convenient for you! <br /><br />Allan Dao is a Computer Science student at the University of Washington, hoping to expand his skills in the field of technology. While at Inglemoor High School, Allan participated in clubs like TSA, FBLA, and HOSA, which has allowed him to gain a variety of skills that are required for future success. For now, he loves working and learning about web design and development. Outside of school, Allan enjoys running with his friends, playing 8-Ball, and spending time with friends and family. Throughout the past few years, technology has been one of his biggest interests, but in recent years, the health field has emerged as interest as well. From his past experiences, Allan has seen and felt the destruction that cancer brings to friends and families. In turn, Allan hopes to utilize technology within WASCAA to spread cancer awareness throughout the community by encouraging other students to take charge and become involved in working to assist the cancer community.
						<br /><br />For Allan, WASCAA is very dear to his heart because of how it directly impacted his father. Three simple words: "You have cancer," created immeasurable stress and fear for his parents. Fortunately, his father is doing very well, which makes Allan extremely thankful and hopeful for the years to come. For the future, WASCAA represents an opportunity to help out others that also feel the pain of cancer, and will Allan's first step on his journey of paying back the cancer community for their  impact both his father's life and his own.</p>
