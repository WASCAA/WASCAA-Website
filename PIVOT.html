                     <h3>Washington Student Cancer Awareness Association</h3>
                     <p style = "text-align: left;">
                        WASCAA, or Washington Student Cancer Awareness Association, is an organization that maintained 501(c)(3) status in the interest of cancer awareness and fundraising, was originally created and run by high school students in the Puget Sound Area. In early winter, many of the students in our initial team had fueled efforts into competing at a HOSA â€“ Future Health Professionals conference, bringing the intersection of community and health to mind. With newly developed skills and a new desire to redirect energy and time more directly towards the community, the initial inklings of WASCAA was formed. Recognizing a gap in our community for a platform to promote independent events, we sought to bring passionate students together, some of whom who had personal connections to folks who had cancer in the past. In particular, we recognized that by being scrappy, we could dramatically reduce the cost of fundraising compared to other nonprofits. Aside from the minimum costs to run our major events, our primary costs have only been our domain and 501(c)(3) nonprofit incorporation and renewal, the former of which has often (especially initially) been paid out of pocket.
                     <br /><br />
                     As we approach the 5 year milestone, we recognize that the Puget Sound area has been an incredibly generous and welcoming community to student-run efforts. Within our local high school and district, we saw great support for our initial event, a movie night featuring Spider-Man Homecoming. With it came early lessons in organization, marketing, and particularly legality. Navigating the law was and remains a common strand in WASCAA's work, and for other student-run organizations, we a core lesson we hope to emphasize is that being scrappy does not mean being sloppy. As momentum built, a fun slogan of ours that helped to continue to drive initial efforts was that "It all starts here." After all, it was simply getting started and sourcing inspiration and support from the talented, passionate, and generous folks around us was what helped us over hurdles along the way. In turn, we have many people to thank: students keen to volunteer, lead, and tutor, community sponsors, and people that were willing to trust and support students with a burning desired, but also burning questions.
                     <br /><br />
                     WASCAA, we hope, has surely had a varied impact on those involved with the organization. We're proud of raising $16k+ through a variety of initiatives, of the initiatives and events themselves, and that we were able to channel the emotion and interests of students into something productive. We're inspired by the developers, photographers, graphic designers, and other excited students looking to utilize their skills. We're excited to see how the lessons and trends we've drawn can continue to inform contributions to the nonprofit community, whether as individuals or through discussions with WASCAA.
                     <br /><br />
                     As with a scrappy startup, we've pivoted, made many mistakes, and re-evaluated sustainability of our way of working often along the way. With the sudden distruption from Covid-19 and re-aligned efforts from past members heading to university and beyond, we're confident that lessons learned and contributions to WASCAA have added to the knowledge that impacts these external communities. As continually echoed, a hearty thank you to many people along the way. As for next steps, we hope to share lessons learned, to keep in touch with our past members and see where each person dives in next, take advantage of resources at UW via WASCAA at the University of Washington, and potentially identify new and more sustainable initiatives that work well with a leaner vision utilizing WASCAA's brand image.
                     <br /><br />
